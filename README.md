# Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
## To Run ##
Simply clone the repository and open index.html in the browser. To edit/add tests, go edit ```jasmine/spec/feedreader.js```. 
## Resources ##
Jasmine Library in order to be able to write my own tests. Everything was provided to us by Udacity as part of the Front-End nanodegree program.
